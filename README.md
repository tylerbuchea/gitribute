### WHAT IS THIS FOR?

Want to be an open source contributor? Search your favorite open source projects code base for **// TODO** comments in the code base.

### HOW DO I DO THAT?

Visit the **[Gitribute site](http://tylerbuchea.com/gitribute)** then just enter your favorite open source projects Github **username/repo** to get a list of files in that repo that contain the keyword **// TODO**.

### WHAT ARE TODO COMMENTS?

It is a widely used practice to add **// TODO** comments to parts of code that need
to be worked on. These parts of the code (in theory) may be the perfect places to start when contributing to an open source project.
